/**
 * <strong>Internal class, do not use directly.</strong>
 *
 * <code>PASV &lt;CRLF&gt;</code><br>
 *
 * This command requests the server-DTP to "listen" on a data port (which is not
 * its default data port) and to wait for a connection rather than initiate one
 * upon receipt of a transfer command. The response to this command includes the
 * host and port address this server is listening on.
 *
 * FTPServer allows the user to configure an "external address" at the listener
 * level which will be the one reported by PASV response. This might solve some of
 * the issues with NATed addresses ( the reported IP is internal and not accesible by the
 * client) but not all of them - for example, if the FTPServer host has a dynamic IP
 * address. The solution for all these cases would be switching to the EPSV command,
 * which doesn't report any IP address back.
 *
 * In the case that EPSV command isn't available to the client, FTPServer integrators
 * can implement their own getPassiveExternalAddress to modify how the External IP
 * is resolved. One common approach would be retrieving this address from a webpage
 * which prints out the visitor's IP address. Another approach could be returning the
 * external IP address from  the USER configuration(as when a single server is mapped
 * into different addresses).
 *
 * Please note that PASV command is an internal classes and thus shouldn't be extended.
 * Integrators may decide to extend it at their own risk, but they should be aware that
 * the 'internal API' can be changed at any moment. Besides, in some environments
 * (OSGI) internal classes are not accesible and thus overriding won't work.
 * Still, the getPassiveExternalAddress method is provided for convenience so the
 * code to overwrite when reimplementing PASV command can be easily located.
