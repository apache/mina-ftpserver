/**
 * Defines methods that all ftplets must implement.
 *
 * A ftplet is a small Java program that runs within an FTP server. Ftplets
 * receive and respond to requests from FTP clients.
 *
 * This interface defines methods to initialize a ftplet, to service requests,
 * and to remove a ftplet from the server. These are known as life-cycle methods
 * and are called in the following sequence:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>The ftplet is constructed.</li>
 * <li>Then initialized with the init method.</li>
 * <li>All the callback methods will be invoked.</li>
 * <li>The ftplet is taken out of service, then destroyed with the destroy
 * method.</li>
 * <li>Then garbage collected and finalized.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * All the callback methods return FtpletEnum. If it returns null
 * FtpletEnum.DEFAULT will be assumed. If any ftplet callback method throws
 * exception, that particular connection will be disconnected.
